Certainly, the `canvas` element can be interacted with using various event properties and methods for different input methods like mouse and pointer (including touch). Below, I'll provide an overview of some commonly used event properties and methods for handling events on a `canvas` element:

### For Mouse Events:

1. `onMouseDown`: This event property is used for handling the mouse button press event.

2. `onMouseUp`: This event property is used for handling the mouse button release event.

3. `onMouseMove`: This event property is used for handling mouse movement over the canvas.

4. `onMouseOver`: This event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the canvas.

5. `onMouseOut`: This event is triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the canvas.

6. `onContextMenu`: This event is triggered when the context menu is requested (usually by right-clicking).

### For Pointer (including Touch) Events:

1. `onPointerDown`: This event property is used for handling the pointer (mouse or touch) button press event.

2. `onPointerUp`: This event property is used for handling the pointer (mouse or touch) button release event.

3. `onPointerMove`: This event property is used for handling pointer (mouse or touch) movement over the canvas.

4. `onPointerOver`: This event is triggered when the pointer enters the canvas.

5. `onPointerOut`: This event is triggered when the pointer leaves the canvas.

6. `onContextMenu`: This event is triggered when the context menu is requested (usually by long-pressing on touch devices).

### Additional Methods:

1. `addEventListener`: You can also add event listeners dynamically using the `addEventListener` method. For example, `canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', myMouseDownHandler)`.

2. `removeEventListener`: Use this method to remove previously added event listeners.

3. `dispatchEvent`: You can programmatically trigger events using the `dispatchEvent` method.

These events and methods can be used to handle user interactions on the canvas element, whether it's mouse-based or pointer-based (including touch). You can choose the appropriate event or method based on your application's requirements and the type of input devices you want to support.
